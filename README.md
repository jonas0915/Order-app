# Order-app

This is a current React Web App that I made guided from the Udemy course that I am currently taking. This 
Application is a Food Ordering App. You may add quanities per with min: 1 & max:5 at a time. Press add and it will 
add it in a cart and in there it will also allow you to increase/decrease the quanity of food you order and
gives you a breakdown of the total amount payable.

This App is work on progress, I will need to add the functionality for the order button fort the final ordering process.
